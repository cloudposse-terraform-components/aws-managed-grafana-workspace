  **Stack Level**: Regional

  Here's an example snippet for how to use this component.

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      grafana:
        metadata:
          component: managed-grafana/workspace
        vars:
          enabled: true
          name: grafana
          private_network_access_enabled: true
          sso_role_associations:
            - role: "ADMIN"
              group_ids:
                - "11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555"
          # This grafana workspace will be allowed to assume the cross
          # account access role from these prometheus components
          prometheus_source_accounts:
            - component: prometheus
              tenant: plat
              stage: sandbox
            - component: prometheus
              tenant: plat
              stage: dev
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > We would prefer to have a custom URL for the provisioned Grafana workspace, but at the moment it's not supported natively and implementation would be non-trivial. We will continue to monitor that Issue and consider alternatives, such as using CloudFront.
